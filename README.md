# Fuel Booking System - Spring Boot Backend

## Overview
The **Booking Management System** is a robust and scalable Spring Boot-based backend designed for efficient management of cylinder bookings, supplier selection, billing, and user authentication. This API-first system is built to support high-traffic operations with secure **authentication**, well-defined **role-based access control**, and automated **email notifications**, including **PDF invoice sending** for bookings.

## Features
- **User Authentication & Authorization** (Spring Security, Role-based Access Control)
- **Comprehensive Supplier Management** (CRUD, Stock Management, Status Updates)
- **Cylinder Inventory Management** (Tracking Booked/Available Cylinders)
- **Booking System with Flexible Scheduling** (Time Slots, Delivery Options, Payment Modes)
- **Billing System with Automated Invoicing** (Including CLECharge for exceeding booking limits)
- **Supplier Selection Strategies** (Most Stock, Least Stock, Round Robin - Strategy Pattern)
- **RESTful API with Well-Structured Endpoints** (For seamless frontend integration)
- **Automated Email Notifications** (With PDF Invoice Attachments)

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot 3.4.2**
- **Java 21**
- **Spring Data JPA** for database interactions
- **Spring Security** for authentication and authorization
- **MySQL Database**
- **Lombok** for boilerplate reduction
- **Thymeleaf** for templating (if required)
- **Spring Boot Mail** for email functionalities
- **Swagger (Springdoc OpenAPI)** for API documentation
- **iText** for PDF generation

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites:
1. **Java 21** installed
2. **Maven** installed
3. **MySQL Database** configured

### Steps to Run:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/KAMRANKHANALWI/Fuel-Agency-SpringBoard.git
   ```
2. Configure **database credentials** in `application.properties`:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_db
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=your_password
   ```
3. Build and run the application:
   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

## Key Concepts

### 1. Security & Authentication
The project employs **Spring Security** to enforce authentication and **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**.

Roles:
- **ADMIN**: Can manage bookings, suppliers, and billing.
- **CUSTOMER**: Can create and manage their bookings.

### 2. Booking System & Business Rules
Customers can book cylinders, but a rule limits them to **6 bookings per year**. Beyond this limit, an additional **Cylinder Limit Exceed Charge (CLECharge)** of **20%** is applied.

### 3. Supplier Selection Strategies (Strategy Pattern)
- **Most Stock Strategy**: Chooses the supplier with the highest stock.
- **Least Stock Strategy**: Chooses the supplier with the lowest stock.
- **Round Robin Strategy**: Distributes bookings evenly among suppliers.
